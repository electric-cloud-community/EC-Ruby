    <!-- The tool description should answer these kinds of questions:
What is the tool itself is used for in the development
process? Who would use this tool? What is the general use-case or
problem that this tool solves? Look at the tool's documentation or
website(s) to get their own descriptions. Look at Wikipedia or other
outside websites. If there is a Hudson plugin, read their
documentation for ideas, examples, etc. It's OK to copy word-for-word
only if appropriate, such as FOSS - but not commercial software.

    <p>Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a
    focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax
    that is natural to read and easy to write.</p>

    <h2>ElectricFlow Integration to Ruby</h2>
    <!-- The integration description should answer the questions:
How deep does our integration go? Why should I care? What general
functionality does the plugin include? What functionality does
the plugin omit?
-->

    <p>@PLUGIN_KEY@ plugin calls the Ruby tool via command line and
    passes the user-provided parameters.</p>

    <p>The @PLUGIN_KEY@ plugin is totally open, because it allows
    the input of any kind of Ruby command, defined in the provided
    TextArea or within a file, when writing the command in the
    TextArea is important to remember to use correct Ruby
    syntax.</p>

    <p>ElectricFlow itself provides some advantages like
    parameters checking, easy functionality selection using only
    check boxes or radio buttons, hitorical log reports, procedure
    duration statistics, simple credentials attachment, real time
    analysis of the log been generated, among others.</p>

    <h2>Integrated Version</h2>

    <p>This plugin was developed and tested against Ruby version
    1.9.3.</p>

    <h1>Plugin Procedures</h1>

    <p>IMPORTANT: For all parameter descriptions below, required
    parameters are shown in <span class='required'>bold
    italics</span>.</p>

    <div id="runRuby"><a name='runRuby' id="runRuby"></a>

    <h3>Run Ruby</h3>

    <p>This procedure allows the input of any Ruby command. When
    the Command is defined the Ruby command is created and run into
    the Commander, displaying at the end the result of it. It
    creates a log file, which contains the output generated by the
    console.</p>

    <p>The Fields 'Input Type' and 'Command' are totally dependent,
    because the selected type must match the command provided or
    otherwise it will not work.</p>

          is called "file(path)" which suggest that the input will
